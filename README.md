## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech-savvy with 6+ years of experience with project management and the [entire systems development lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle). Fluent in English, I specialize in crafting tailored solutions that align with business objectives. Over recent years, I have led cross-functional teams, collaborating closely with customers and stakeholders to translate their needs into technology-driven solutions using [appropriate technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology).
